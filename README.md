# Amazon Price Tracker

## Overview

This project allows you to track the prices of selected products on Amazon using two Python scripts:

- `amazon_excel_creator.py`: Create and manage a list of products in an Excel file.

- `main.py`: Monitor price changes of the tracked products and send email alerts for price drops.

## Purpose of Files

- `amazon_excel_creator.py`: This script is used to create and manage a list of products you want to track on Amazon. It scrapes product data from Amazon web pages and stores it in the excel file "amazon_tracker.xslsx".

- `main.py`: This script continuously monitors the prices of the tracked products on Amazon. If there's a price drop below the desired threshold, it sends an email alert.

## How It Works

1. **Adding Products to Track:**
   - Run `amazon_excel_creator.py` to add and manage products to the tracking list.
   - Provide the product links, and the script will scrape and store their details in the Excel file "amazon_tracker.xlsx".

2. **Monitoring Price Drops:**
   - Run `main.py` to check the prices of the tracked products on Amazon.
   - If a price drop is detected below the desired threshold, the script sends an email alert.

## Automation Options

- **Online Automation (Recommended):**
  - For online automation, consider using [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).
  - Upload `main.py` to PythonAnywhere along with the Excel file generated by `amazon_excel_creator.py`.
  - Set up a scheduled task on PythonAnywhere to run `main.py` at specified intervals.

- **Local Automation (Windows):**
  - To automate on your local machine (Windows), you can use Windows Task Scheduler.
  - Create a task that runs `main.py` at desired intervals.

**Note**: Ensure that the required Python libraries (`openpyxl`, `requests`, `bs4`, `yagmail`) are installed in the environment where you plan to run the scripts.
- Make sure to provide your email credentials in the main.py file and also select the reciever mail (By Default, It is mine)
- Generate App Passwords and only they should be used as email credentials for safety reasons, (Research more about app passwords)
